                <h3>Starting your Journey</h3>
                <p> <mark>Key Things:</mark></p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong>Take Care of Yourself:</strong> Remember that practicing mindfulness is like giving
                        yourself a break—a chance to feel better and stronger. You're important, and it's okay to put
                        yourself first sometimes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice Makes Progress:</strong> It's okay if mindfulness feels tricky at first. Like
                        any skill, it takes time to get better. Don't get discouraged if your mind wanders; just keep
                        trying, and you'll improve over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enjoy the Moment: </strong>Focus on what's happening right now, without worrying about
                        the past or future. Notice the little things around you, like the sound of birds or the feeling
                        of your breath. Each moment you spend being present is a step toward feeling happier and more at
                        peace.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Questions to ask yourself:</h3>
                <p><em>Really think about your answer and what makes you feel that way.</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are my goals realistic?</li>
                    <li>Are my expectations of myself obtainable?</li>
                    <li>Do I believe in myself?</li>

                <p> <mark>Steps to follow:</mark></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Breathe - nothing is perfect and it's okay to failing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Follow your game plan - it won't be perfect but it's just a guide and it can be adjusted.
                    </li>
                    <li>Savor the experience - each time you practice will be different,, soon you will figure out what
                        works and feels comfortable for you</li>
                    <li>Have fun - you're getting to know you and enjoy the present moments, so enjoy them!</li>
                </ol>

            <section>
                <h3>Stay Present</h3>
                <p class="flex-paragraph">
                    <span><em>Give yourself the opportunity to truly give it a chance.</em></span>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Being present when practicing mindfulness is important because it helps us fully experience and
                        appreciate the present moment without being distracted by worries about the past or future. By
                        focusing on the here and now, we can cultivate greater awareness of our thoughts, emotions, and
                        sensations, leading to increased clarity and self-understanding. This allows us to respond to
                        life's challenges with intentionality and resilience, fostering a sense of peace and well-being.
