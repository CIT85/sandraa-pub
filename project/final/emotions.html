                <h3>Emotional Emotions</h3>
                <p> <mark>Key Things:</mark></p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong>Know Your Feelings:</strong> Pay attention to how you're feeling—whether you're happy,
                        sad, or mad. It's important to understand your emotions so you can deal with them in a healthy
                        way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Express Yourself:</strong>Find ways to show your feelings, like talking to someone you
                        trust or writing them down. Keeping your emotions bottled up inside can make you feel stressed,
                        so it's good to let them out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Express Yourself:</strong>Figure out what you're comfortable with and say no when you
                        need to. It's okay to set boundaries to protect your feelings and make sure others treat you
                        well.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Take Care of Yourself:</strong>Make time for things that make you feel good, like
                        getting enough sleep, exercising, and doing activities you enjoy. Taking care of yourself helps
                        keep your emotions in check and makes you feel happier overall.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Emotional health is about how we feel on the inside and how we deal with our feelings. It's like
                        having a toolkit for handling different emotions, whether they're good or bad. When we're
                        emotionally healthy, we can manage stress, get along with others, and feel happy most of the
                        time. It's all about knowing how to take care of our feelings, build strong relationships, and
                        stay positive even when things get tough.</li>
