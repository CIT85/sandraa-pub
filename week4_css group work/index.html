            <h2>What to know about Sourdough</h2>
            <p>Sourdough is a type of bread made from naturally fermented dough. It requires only flour, water, and
                salt, along with wild yeast and bacteria present in the environment. Sourdough relies on wild yeast and
                lactobacilli bacteria present in the environment. These microorganisms are captured in a starter
                culture, which is a mixture of flour and water that's regularly fed to keep it active and healthy.
                Remember sourdough is living and requires care, think of it as a pet. </p>

                <h3>Things to remember about Sourdough</h3>
                <p> <mark>Key Things:</mark></p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong>Natural Fermentation:</strong> Sourdough relies on wild yeast and bacteria for
                        leavening, captured in a
                        starter culture of flour and water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Flavor:</strong> The fermentation process gives sourdough its distinct tangy
                        flavor and creates a
                        more complex taste profile compared to bread made with commercial yeast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Potential Health Benefits:</strong> Sourdough fermentation breaks down gluten and phytic
                        acid, making it
                        easier to digest and potentially offering a lower glycemic index compared to other bread types.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Some Sample Supplies
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flour:</strong> High-quality flour is essential for sourdough baking. All-purpose flour
                    or bread flour
                    works well, but you can also experiment with whole wheat or rye flour for added flavor.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Water:</strong> Use filtered or non-chlorinated water for feeding your starter and
                    mixing your dough.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Container:</strong> A jar or container to store your sourdough starter. Choose a
                    container with enough
                    room for your starter to expand during fermentation.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Kitchen Scale:</strong> A digital kitchen scale is useful for accurately measuring
                    ingredients by weight,
                    which is important for consistent results in sourdough baking.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Mixing Bowls:</strong> You'll need mixing bowls of various sizes for mixing and
                    fermenting your dough.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Dough Scraper:</strong> A dough scraper is handy for handling and shaping sticky
                    sourdough dough.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Knife:</strong> Also known as a bench scraper, this tool helps with dividing and shaping
                    dough.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Banneton or Proofing Basket:</strong> A banneton or proofing basket is used to support
                    the shape of your
                    dough during the final proofing stage.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Linen Cloth or Kitchen Towel:</strong> Use a linen cloth or kitchen towel to line your
                    proofing basket
                    and cover your dough during fermentation.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Dutch Oven or Baking Stone:</strong> A Dutch oven or baking stone creates steam in the
                    oven, resulting in
                    a crispy crust for your sourdough bread.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Lame or Sharp Knife:</strong> A lame (pronounced lah-may) or sharp knife is used to
                    score the top of your
                    bread before baking, allowing it to expand properly in the oven.
                </li>



                <li>
                    <strong>Oven Thermometer:</strong> An oven thermometer ensures that your oven is at the correct
                    temperature for
                    baking.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Cooling Rack:</strong> A cooling rack allows air to circulate around your freshly baked
                    bread, preventing
                    it
                    from becoming soggy.
                </li>

            <h2>Getting a Starter</h2>

            <section>
                <p>You don't have to travel to San Francisco, <abbr title="California">CA</abbr> to get a starter. No
                    need
                    to travel <em> soooo</em> far. Starters can be made at home or even ordered online. Keep in mind it
                    doesn't matter how you get your starter you will still need to "feed" it.</p>
                <h3>Creating a starter</h3>

                <p>Creating a sourdough starter from scratch is a rewarding process that requires just two simple
                    ingredients: flour and water. Here's a basic guide to creating your own sourdough starter:</p>

                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Whole grain flour (such as whole wheat or rye flour)</li>
                    <li>All-purpose flour (or bread flour)</li>
                    <li>Water (non-chlorinated, preferably filtered)</li>
                </ul>

                        Main Ingredients
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>


                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Day 1:</strong>

                        In a clean jar or container, mix together 50 grams (or about 1/4 cup) of whole grain flour with
                        50 grams (or about 1/4 cup) of water until well combined. Make sure the consistency is similar
                        to thick pancake batter.
                        Cover the jar loosely with a lid or cloth and let it sit at room temperature (ideally around
                        70-75°F or 21-24°C) for 24 hours.</li>

                    <li> <strong>Day 2:</strong>
                        After 24 hours, discard half of the mixture in the jar.

                        Add to the jar 50 grams (or about 1/4 cup) of whole grain flour and 50 grams (or about 1/4 cup)
                        of water. Stir until well combined.
                        Cover the jar loosely and let it sit at room temperature for another 24 hours.</li>

                    <li><strong>Day 3 and beyond:</strong>
                        6. Repeat the discarding and feeding process once a day. As the starter becomes more active, you
                        may notice bubbles forming on the surface and a slightly sour smell.

                        Continue daily feedings until your starter is consistently doubling in size within 6-8 hours
                        after feeding and has a pleasant sour aroma. This process typically takes 5-7 days but may vary
                        depending on environmental factors.</li>

                <h3>Aquiring a pre-started starter</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Review Instructions:</strong> If you received a pre-started sourdough starter from a
                        friend or purchased one, review any instructions provided. Different starters may have specific
                        care requirements, such as feeding ratios or storage conditions.
                    </li>

                    <li> <strong>Transfer and Assess:</strong> Transfer the pre-started starter to a clean jar or
                        container if it's not already in one. Take a moment to observe its appearance and smell. A
                        healthy starter should have a slightly sour smell and show signs of activity, such as bubbles on
                        the surface.</li>

                    <li><strong>Feed the Starter:</strong> If the pre-started starter hasn't been recently fed, it's a
                        good idea to give it a feeding to refresh it. Follow the feeding instructions provided with the
                        starter or use a 1:1:1 ratio (equal parts by weight or volume of starter, flour, and water).
                        Discard a portion of the starter before feeding to maintain the right ratio and prevent
                        overflow.</li>

                    <li><strong>Observe and Repeat:</strong> After feeding, observe the starter over the next several
                        hours. It should become active, showing signs of fermentation. Depending on its condition and
                        your baking schedule, you may need to repeat the feeding process daily or every few days.</li>

                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Consistency is key to caring for your pre-started sourdough
                        starter. Stick to a regular feeding schedule and observe how the starter responds to feeding and
                        ambient conditions. Adjust your feeding frequency or ratios as needed to keep the starter
                        healthy and active.</li>

                    <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> When not in use, store your pre-started sourdough starter in
                        the refrigerator. This slows down fermentation and reduces the need for frequent feedings.
                        Before using the starter in a recipe, bring it to room temperature and give it a feeding to
                        refresh it.</li>

            <h2>Feeding the Starter</h2>
            <p> It is essential to keep your sourdough starter healthy and active. Here's how to do it:</p>
            <!--<section>-->
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong> Preparation: </strong>Before feeding your starter, ensure your hands and utensils are
                    clean, and prepare a
                    clean jar or container to hold your starter.
                </li>


                <li> <strong>Start by discarding a portion of your starter.</strong> You can discard anywhere from a
                    small portion to half of
                    the starter, depending on your preference and how much starter you want to maintain.</li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Flour and Water:</strong> After discarding, replenish the remaining starter with equal
                    parts of flour and
                    water. A common ratio is 1:1:1, meaning equal parts by weight or volume of starter, flour, and
                    water. For example, if you have 100 grams of starter, you would add 100 grams of flour and 100
                    grams
                    of water.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Mix:</strong> Stir the mixture thoroughly until the flour and water are fully
                    incorporated into the starter.
                    Ensure there are no dry pockets of flour.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>Cover and Let Rest:</strong> Cover the jar or container loosely with a lid or cloth. Let
                    the starter rest at
                    room temperature, ideally between 70-75°F (21-24°C), away from drafts and direct sunlight.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Observation:</strong> After feeding, observe your starter over the next several hours.
                    It should become
                    active, showing signs of fermentation such as bubbles forming on the surface and a slight
                    increase
                    in volume.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Maintenance:</strong> Depending on your baking schedule and the activity of your
                    starter, you may need to
                    repeat the feeding process daily or every few days to keep it healthy and active.
                </li>

                <li> <strong>Remember to maintain consistency in feeding your starter.</strong> Regular feedings and
                    observation will help
                    you maintain a strong and active sourdough starter, ready to leaven your bread.</li>
